How do I approach designing software?
  Mapping out and figuring out the initial layout of what I am to create is where I generally start. I then start finding different ways of accomplishing the tasks through 
  researching through different forums and sites.
  
How do I approach developing programs?
  I will first create the skeletal form of the program with the basic levels of functionality. I then proceed to adding the different functions/manipulation elements to the 
  program. I do this one at a time so that I know where to look when an issue comes up with the integration of the new functions/methods. I continue this process until I am 
  able to create the satisfactory product that is requested.
  
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Computer science hleps me achieve my goals through the constant development of new programs/libraries that can assist with creating new programs. Computer science is like a self sustaining "entity" the more it advances, the quicker and easier it can advance further.
